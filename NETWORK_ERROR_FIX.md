# Network Error Handling Solution

## Problem
When users turned off their internet connection, the app was experiencing `ClientException` errors related to Supabase API calls and automatically logging users out. This was happening because:

1. The app couldn't distinguish between network errors and actual authentication failures
2. Network errors were being treated as authentication failures, causing automatic logout
3. No retry mechanism was in place for network operations
4. No proactive network connectivity detection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Connectivity Plus Package
- Added `connectivity_plus: ^6.0.5` to `pubspec.yaml`
- This package provides real-time network connectivity status

### 2. Created Connectivity Service (`lib/core/utils/connectivity_service.dart`)
- Singleton service that monitors network connectivity changes
- Provides real-time network status updates via streams
- Includes methods to check connectivity status

### 3. Enhanced Error Utils (`lib/core/common/widgets/error_utils.dart`)
- Improved network error detection with more comprehensive keywords
- Added retry logic helpers with exponential backoff
- Added specific handling for Supabase-related network errors

### 4. Created Retry Helper (`lib/core/utils/retry_helper.dart`)
- Implements exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Provides connectivity-aware retry logic
- Configurable retry attempts and delays

### 5. Updated Authentication Repository (`lib/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository_impl.dart`)
- Added connectivity checks before making API calls
- Implemented retry mechanism for network operations
- Better error handling to distinguish network errors from auth failures

### 6. Enhanced Auth Bloc (`lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/auth_bloc.dart`)
- Improved error handling to prevent unnecessary logouts on network errors
- Added logic to maintain user session during network issues
- Better handling of user status checks during network problems

### 7. Created Network-Aware Widgets
- `NetworkStatusWidget`: Shows network status indicator
- `NetworkAwareScaffold`: Wrapper for screens with network awareness
- `NetworkAwareErrorWidget`: Context-aware error display

### 8. Updated Main App (`lib/main.dart`)
- Wrapped the app with network status monitoring
- Added retry functionality for authentication when network is restored
- Integrated connectivity service initialization

## Key Features

### Network Error Detection
The app now recognizes various network error patterns:
- `SocketException`
- `ClientException`
- `Failed host lookup`
- `Can't assign requested address`
- Supabase-specific errors
- Connection timeouts

### Graceful Degradation
- Users are not logged out when network issues occur
- Previous user state is maintained during network problems
- Clear error messages inform users about network status

### Retry Mechanism
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Connectivity-aware retry logic
- Configurable retry attempts

### User Experience
- Network status indicator shows when internet is unavailable
- Retry buttons allow manual retry of failed operations
- Clear error messages guide users on what to do

## Usage Examples

### Using Network-Aware Scaffold
```dart
NetworkAwareScaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Screen')),
  onRetry: () => context.read<AuthBloc>().add(AuthIsUserLoggedIn()),
  body: MyContent(),
)
```

### Using Network-Aware Error Widget
```dart
NetworkAwareErrorWidget(
  errorMessage: error.toString(),
  onRetry: () => retryOperation(),
  title: 'Connection Error',
  customMessage: 'Unable to load data. Please try again.',
)
```

### Using Retry Helper
```dart
final result = await RetryHelper.retryWithConnectivity(
  operation: () => apiCall(),
  checkConnectivity: () => connectivityService.checkConnectivity(),
  maxAttempts: 3,
);
```

## Testing

To test the network error handling:

1. **Turn off internet connection** while using the app
2. **Verify that users are not logged out** automatically
3. **Check that appropriate error messages** are displayed
4. **Turn internet back on** and verify retry functionality works
5. **Test app startup** with no internet connection

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users are not unexpectedly logged out
2. **Better Error Handling**: Clear distinction between network and auth errors
3. **Automatic Recovery**: App automatically retries when network is restored
4. **Reduced Support Issues**: Fewer complaints about unexpected logouts
5. **Robust Network Handling**: Comprehensive network error detection and recovery
